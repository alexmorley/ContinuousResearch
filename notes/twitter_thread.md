CONTINUOUS RESEARCH: Open, Integrated, and Decentralized. Thread! https://alexmorley.me/2018/continuous-research

Very few, if any, real problems in Research will be indisputablely resolved by one paper. We try to continuously update our theories based on the currently available evidence. But this is hard, error prone, and doesn't help non-specialists.

One issue is that there are very few explicit threads keeping related pieces of research tied together.

Another is that pieces of research are often framed as such -a single entity to be consumed as such. But in reality they are modular and sometimes only little pieces need be improved/changed.

I've been thinking (and starting to build) a potential solution. A framework where integration, collaboration & open are the default.

The framework will be designed with decentralization in mind. Allowing anyone to collaborate with the lowest possible barriers, in terms of skills or cost. Importantly, no one party will be in charge of how the framework is used or developed.

Sound ambitious? Hell yeah. Impossible? Hopefully not! Feedback? Yes please! Here's a link to the github repo https://github.com/alexmorley/ContinuousResearch.
