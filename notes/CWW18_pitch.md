## Continuous Science

The rise-cost computing and massive software projects gave rise to the need for continuous integration. Automatic & frequent testing of any changes to the code-base such that the software is kept close to "release-ready" at all times.

In research two different trends (on top of low-cost computing) could contribute to a similar framework becoming mainstream for science. Open/shareable data & lot's of good tooling for reproducible analytical pipelines (docker, jupyter etc.).

At the top we see a rough framework that encompasses most research.
