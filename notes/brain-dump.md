How many people read the original research papers behind what they read in the media? How many people say they are pretty confident understanding those papers? Have you ever read something in the news then read the exact opposite thing some time later?

Conflict between giving reader all the information they need (reproducibility etc) and helping them to understand the research in its wider context.
