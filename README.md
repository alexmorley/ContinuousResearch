This repository contains [the whitepaper](https://alexmorley.me/ContinuousResearch/) and other notes, resources and diagrams related to the concept of "Continuous Research". Please leave any feedback in the issues or email me :) There's a summary :point_down:

### Bringing Continuous Delivery to Reserach
Science today is built almost entirely on a culture of competition. Formal integration of research from different groups working on the same topic happens very rarely. When it does happen, for example when results/algorithms are explicitly compared, these results are often highly biased or incomplete.

Continuous Research is the concept that all scientific outputs, every new dataset, technique, and hypothesis, can be can be integrated such a way that they are re-evaluated against all related research. In developer-speak we could say that we're "bringing Continuous Delivery to research".
